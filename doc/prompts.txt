I opened an empty github repo for the new app that we are going to build. The app is called photosono. The app must be written in Java and must be a spring boot 4 app. Maven must be used. The artifactid is photosono and the group id must be com.flaute. Once it is started, a configured input directory must be periodically scanned for (new) files, and if the files are of a known media type of photos and videos the file will be copied to an output folder. The file in the output folder must be named like the sha256 hash of the original file. Doing so will make sure, that the output folder will only contain unique files. Identical files in the input folder (multiple identical files in different places) will be found and analyzed but not copied again if the output folder already holds a file with the same hash filename. All accepted file types (filename extensions) of photos and videos must be normalized in the output folder. Example: .JPG, .jpg, .jpeg, .JPEG must all be normalized to .jpg. As there will be thousands of unique files in the output directory, a directory structure must be added. In the output folder there must be further folders with the first two characters/digits of the filenames. Ex. /output/a9 for all files that start with "a9" and so on.

Great, works! Thank you! Now let's add some more features. The new output directory should be kept as it is, as the files are unique and can be backuped manually. But this output directory is then again the new input directory for the next step. All files in the output directory must be recursively traversed and analyzed to find any information about the creation date of the files. The creation date must be found trying to get the best quility possible. EXIF information could be helpfull for example. If so, use the following order of priority for the attributes found: DateTimeOriginal CreateDate ModifyDate SubSecDateTimeOriginal SubSecCreateDate SubSecModifyDate FileModifyDate. If the creation date was found in the file, it must be copied to another, new output folder, that is structured by date like so: YYYY/MM/DD and the file itself must be named with the following pattern: YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.<extension> If a file with exactly the same timestamp already exists, the pattern must be extended with an incrementing counter like so: YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-C.<extension> with "C" counting up starting with 1..n

Well done, thanks! Now let's make the app more easy to deploy and use. The app must be containerized into a docker container. The  input-dir, output-dir, final-output-dir and scan-interval properties must be set from outside of the docker container. I also need a ready-to-go docker-compose.yaml file to start the docker container.

When writing the file to the timeline output directory it must not only be checked if a file with the given name already exists. If it exists, it must be checked it the file that is about to be copied to that folder is identical (same sha256 hash) to the one that is already there. If so, copy must be skipped. If it is not identical (same hash) it must be copied with an incremented counter in the filename. That way only unique files with same timestamps will be copied to the timeline directory.

Ok, everything is working fine now. Now add some Junit tests for all services.
